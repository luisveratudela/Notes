# The title of document

A very small introduction to the document, followed by a horizontal line.

---

## A table of content

1 [Text and code](#text-and-code)
2 [Other stuff](#other-stuff)

##Text and code

Some `code` will be explained in-line.

Other will be highlighted to better readability.

```python
import pandas as import pd
data = pd.DataFrame(mydata)
```

And explained via external [link](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

##Other stuff

Tables are quite useful.
