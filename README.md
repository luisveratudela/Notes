# The title

A very small introduction to the document, followed by a horizontal line...

---

And some comment.

## A table of content

1 [Text and code](#text-and-code)
2 [Tables and figures](#tables-and-figures)

### Text and code

Some `code` will be explained in-line.

Other will be highlighted to better readability.

```python
import pandas as import pd
data = pd.DataFrame(mydata)
```

And explained via external [link](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

### Tables and figures

Tables are quite useful. 

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | This is item number one. |
| 2 | This item number two. |

Adding an embedded image, say a pythocat:
